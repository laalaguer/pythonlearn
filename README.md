# Welcome to Python Tutorial Place
## Purpose
This is the place where I put an end to the Python 2.7 learning.
I am doing web framework development and trying very hard to please my customers.
So this is the actual place I can get some rest and touch some pure code of python.
## History of Python
While I am composing this article, Python 3 is 54% and Python 2.x is 46% of the choice right now. Though many features are similar in Python 3 and Python 2.7. But for Python 2.5 or lower, you will have a lot of work to do to port your code into Python 3.
## Lesson Sepeartion
I will try to fix each section into a folder. So later on I can go back and make a video of them.
## Why I am Doing This
Because I want to explore and make a small web framework like Webapp2. I want to know how to build some piece of framework. In my daily job, I use only a subset of features in Python.
